# Password Penalty

Implement a function called `penaltyPoints` which receives a password code and returns the penalty points awarded to that password.

## Penalty rules

- Sequence of 2 characters/numbers are awarded 1 penalty point
- Sequences of 3 or more characters/numbers are awarded 2 penalty points

### Examples

1. The password `2hT62g33u7` has 1 penalty point for the sequence of `3`'s;
2. The password `yh53GGf7h6` has 1 penalty point for the sequence of `G`'s;
3. The password `hg6666WT5s` has 2 penalty points for the sequence of `6`'s;
4. The password `hg6WTTT5ms` has 2 penalty points for the sequence of `T`'s;
